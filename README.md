Welcome welcome!

My name is Phoonum Saelao, but I prefer using "Reificios" online since my name is kinda hard to say in English.
Currently a CE student at Kasetsart University!

I am mostly working with backend related stuff. But I'm also interested in game developement too!

Most of the repositories will likely be university works and some silly project I made (which a lot of them is quite silly).

These are the languages and tools that I mostly use.
Python
JavaScript NodeJS Express
MongoDB
GIT
C# mostly for Unity

I also use these but will be less skilled that above.
C
C++
HTML
CSS

Some stats too, if you're curios
